# LibreElec_RPi-Addons
## Introduction
This repo provides details on additonal features to add to RPis running LibreElec. The additional features include:

- 5V fan control based on CPU temperature (on/off and PWM)
- Power Button

## Required Hardware
Before beginning these add-ons will require the folllowing hardware. 

For the Fan Temperature Control, you will need:

- 5V Fan
- NPN Transistor
- Diode
- 10kohm and 330kohm resistors

For the Power Button, you will need:

- Momentary Normally-Open (NO) switch/button

## Setup
To get started, the first step is to prototype the circuitry. The schematic below detailed a method of setting up the control circuit.
